  <p>
    You were the first senior colleague I interacted with in the team and I remember the first piece of advice was to use the HOME and END keys to move to the start and end of a terminal command (lifesaver). You made those initial nervous days working in a new team enjoyable and eased me into it. Your dedication and hardwork inspired me to do more, learn more and be a better version of myself and I thank you for that.
 <p>
   You also helped me get comfortable with kubernates and helm and whenever I would get stuck with it, the first thing that would come to mind was "Himani would know". Working on CNF will not be the same without you.

   All the best for the future and hope we get to meet someday!! Untill then I bid thee Farewell, Queen of Helms
