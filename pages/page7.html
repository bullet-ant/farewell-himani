      But beyond the work walls, you were more than just a colleague—you were a true friend. Whether it was sharing our little hobby projects or just having a good laugh after work, you always knew how to make things better. You had my back during the stressful times, and I can't tell you how much that meant to me. I'm really going to miss our chats and the good times we shared.
